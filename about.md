# About Me

I am a Research Scientist with a PhD in Theoretical Physics from the [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](https://www.umass.edu). 

My graduate research has focused on using tools from Statistical Physics, Quantum Information, and efficient algorithms to tackle problems in Quantum Many-Body Dynamics. 

More recently, I have worked on industry-driven problems in Finance and Optimization using quantum and quantum-inspired (tensor networks) algorithms. My contributions there include the development of constrained tensor networks for generative modeling and combinatorial optimization problems.
